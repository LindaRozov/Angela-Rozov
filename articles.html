            <p>Small, helpless - how not to help him. We dress, we put on shoes, we move our hands, we suggest words, we speak and think for him ...</p>
            <p>We are indignant: what a dependent! We are worried: will he learn? As a result, we play it safe and deprive the child of the opportunity to realize their competencies and acquire competencies.</p>
            <p>What the child has the right to, that is, what is within his competence: to establish relationships and communicate with different people, to express his judgments, thoughts and feelings, to start and perform joint actions, to try and make mistakes, to do in his own way, and not according to the model, and much more other.</p>
            <p>How to be…</p>
            <p>Before helping, one should observe - is help needed?</p>
            <p>Think about what caused the desire to help: the need of the child or the desire of an adult to speed up events (dress faster), give the game the right direction (in fact, switch), hear the desired answer, see the expected action (do it for him).</p>
            <p>Help should be given when the child asks for help.</p>
            <p>And now - how.</p>
            <p>First ask: what did you want to do, what exactly is not working for you, how would you like to do it if you could do it yourself. What help do you need, how can I help you, who can help, who would you turn to for help?</p>
            <p>In this way, you will help the child to recognize the difficulty and put it into words.</p>
            <p>After the difficulty is identified, it is possible to correctly determine what kind of help is needed - a hint, support, approval, confirmation of the correctness of actions, demonstration, etc.</p>
            <p>If the child has the opportunity to act consciously and independently, he will acquire his own unique experience.</p>
            <p>In this way, we will contribute to the development of its competence and autonomy.</p>

            <p>If you want to find a soul mate, you should first of all stop obsessive searches and take care of yourself, otherwise you will not be able to notice the ideal partner, even if he is two steps away from you. He appears in your life when you are ready for his appearance.</p>
            <p>In order to prepare for a meeting with an ideal partner, you must first know yourself.</p>
            <p>Self-sufficiency is the basis of intimacy</p>
            <p>At the age of twenty, we all strive for independence and do not want to depend on our parents. We experiment to understand what we are, what we don't have, what we can do, what we need, and what we can do without.</p>
            <p>As we become independent and mature individuals, we begin to expect more from close relationships.</p>
            <p>Even if a person goes through a breakup with a long-term partner or a divorce at the age of sixty-five, he is in the same position as a twenty-year-old. First of all, he needs to regain a sense of independence, since self-sufficiency is the basis of intimacy. He who gives himself over to despondency, instead of looking for a life partner, is like a hungry man prowling in search of food. In this state, a person is looking for someone who could satisfy his hunger. Meanwhile, only those who are able to satisfy their hunger can see a kindred spirit in another person and get close to him. Only in this case, taking care of a partner and his taking care of us can bring real pleasure.</p>
            <p>By becoming self-sufficient, we are no longer satisfied with relationships based on physical attraction and interest. It does not depend on age. It's just that an independent person considers his relationship with a partner not as an opportunity to have a good time, but as a chance to get to know his chosen one and himself. Gaining independence, a person naturally begins to comprehend everything that his relationship with a partner can teach him.</p>
            <p>Soul Mate Doesn't Mean "Perfect Person"</p>
            <p>It must be borne in mind that the ideal partner is not perfection at all, not an ideal person without flaws and shortcomings. The ideal partner does not have all the virtues that you think a good person should have. The ideal partner can make mistakes. Like you, he is sometimes lucky, and sometimes unlucky. The appearance of your ideal partner may not match your idea of beauty. He may have physical defects. In other words, in general, an ideal partner cannot serve as an ideal, but if you treat him with an open mind and understand him, he becomes an ideal for you.</p>
            <p>The love that you spontaneously feel for such a person makes you comprehend the laws of living together with someone who is different from you in many ways. Thanks to love, we learn to understand and respect another person, find a common language with him, take care of him and admire him. In the course of this process, which does not always proceed without complications, we change for the better. Thanks to such relationships, the soul enters the time of maturity.</p>
            <p>If your soul mate does not present a challenge to you, you will not be able to grow. If you are lucky enough to find the perfect partner, you will be able to show all your best qualities. Sometimes this happens at the moment when it is necessary to overcome obstacles. In the process of married life, you often get the opportunity to know yourself from the worst side. You are convinced that you are able to judge too harshly, to find fault, to think only about yourself, to bother your neighbors with your whims, suspicions and doubts. Living together with an ideal partner allows you to get rid of these shortcomings. When your hidden shortcomings appear, you not only harden your will, but also begin to appreciate the love that lives in your heart and helps you cope with any difficulties. That's when your soul acquires wings and, like a butterfly, soars into the sky.</p>
            <p>How to understand what you feel</p>
            <p>If you strive for perfection in everything, no one will be able to please you until you open your heart. When you yourself cannot understand how your partner makes you feel, just wait, and in time you will be visited by insight. In the event that this person suits you, you can stay with him. If your chosen one was not the one you were looking for, you can part with him. It should be noted that after parting, you should not think about the past for at least one year.</p>

            <p>Depression is a depressed state, which is manifested by a chronic feeling of melancholy, confusion, apathy, an indifferent attitude to reality, a crushing feeling of guilt and the inability to enjoy life, a tendency to loneliness and peace.</p>
            <p>Maintaining emotional tone is of equal concern to everyone: both those who have made a career and live outwardly prosperous lives, and those who today are fighting for a minimum.</p>
            <p>Experts say that regardless of whether you are suffering from an attack of melancholy or are in a state of deep depression, you yourself are able to get out of this state.</p>
            <p>The whole secret is to stop looking for reasons and start doing something.</p>
            <p>You can help yourself by following these tips.</p>
            <p><b>Tip 1</b> The most effective way to deal with chronic depression is to seek help from a psychologist. A psychologist can teach you how to overcome sadness, feelings of hopelessness and correct yourself with low self-esteem.</p>
            <p><b>Tip 2</b> Do something that lifts your spirits. It doesn't matter what you want to do, as long as it's something active. Go for a walk, ride a bike, visit friends, read, play chess or play with the kids. Pamper yourself.</p>
            <p><b>Tip 3</b> Don't make life-changing decisions, such as moving, changing jobs, divorce, without discussing the issue with close friends or relatives who you trust. Postpone making important decisions until you are out of depression.</p>
            <p><b>Tip 4</b> Don't be alone. Spend time with other people. Try to talk to them about things that are not related to depression. If talking about your problems brings tears, don't try to hold them back.</p>
            <p><b>Tip 5</b> Don't overeat or skip meals. Eat a healthy, well-balanced diet.</p>
            <p><b>Tip 6</b> Get exercise. Studies show that depressed people feel better if they exercise regularly. Such outdoor activities (jogging, walking, swimming, cycling) are especially useful.</p>
            <p><b>Tip 7</b>Analyze the facts. Sometimes, when you start comparing your assumptions with reality, you find that things are not as bad as you previously thought.</p>
            <p><b>Tip 8</b> Don't take on too many challenges or take on too many responsibilities. If you expect too much from yourself, it can increase the risk of failure, which will make you feel worse.</p>

            <p>People who don't know how to say no when taken advantage of or asked to do something that the asker could have done live a real hard life. Internally, they despise themselves for their softness and pliability, periodically decide to "break free", but they really cannot take a single step to defend their independence.</p>
            <p>Gradually, they cease to live “their own life”, putting their goals, interests and desires in the background, more and more “putting on” the role of a “serving” person, always ready to help another. They begin to live by the affairs of the other and strive to achieve the goals of the other. "Forgetting himself" for another person who uses and enslaves them, they become uninteresting for him and he can leave them and go to the "conquest" of new "slaves". And the life of the abandoned "old servant" is really an empty life: it has no goals, desires and interests. There is nothing in it but the painful expectation of its "owner" ...</p>
            <p>When do we agree to this terrible "slavery" - slavery without chains and whips? At what point in our lives do we begin to agree to help another person when we ourselves are busy or when we don’t want to do it at all? When we put aside our own affairs and the affairs of our loved ones and, cursing everything in the world, rush to help another, although we ourselves live hard and are forced to save every ruble or every minute?</p>
            <p>Suppressing our internal resistance, we agree to an unpleasant duty for ourselves in such cases:</p>
            <li>when we want to be always kind to everyone;</li>
            <li>when we want everyone to always love us;</li>
            <li>when we do not know how to respect ourselves, regardless of the opinions of the people around us;</li>
            <li>when our self-esteem and attitude towards ourselves depend on the assessment and attitude of other people towards us;</li>
            <li>when our self-esteem and attitude towards ourselves depend on the assessment and attitude of other people towards us;</li>
            <li>when we are, therefore, internally not free and over-dependent on other people.</li>
            <p>How to refuse without offending (refusal formula)</p>
            <p>There is a simple refusal formula that you can learn and say almost automatically when you cannot or do not want to run to the rescue at the first call of another person.</p>
            <p>This formula consists in the fact that you pronounce three basic phrases:</p>
            <li>a phrase containing positive content (a positive assessment of your interlocutor, an assessment of your relationship with him, an assessment of the situation);</li>
            <li>a phrase containing negative content (the wording of the refusal and its objective reasons);</li>
            <li>a phrase containing again positive content (a positive forecast that sometime in the future you will be able to help your partner because you treat him well).</li>
            <p>Thus, you act on the principle of a "communicative pie": top and bottom - "sweet dough", and inside - "salty filling".</p>
            <p>The rejection formula above is effective because it is based on the psychological laws of perception and communication. Namely, a person focuses attention and emotionally reacts to the beginning and end of communication, remembers the beginning and end of the conversation better, and the content of the middle is somewhat “blurred”, does not carry any special emotional load for him and is often perceived more calmly. Especially if this middle is “permeated” with objective reasons that caused your refusal.</p>
            <p>An exercise. Suppose you are experiencing a chronic lack of time, effort and energy. You have a lot of important things planned for you, for which you have to find time. You are in a hurry to do everything and rejoice at the fact that everything turns out quickly for you.</p>
            <p>Suddenly - an unexpected call. A friend calls and asks for a favor. You painfully hesitate: before your eyes - an open computer, a dismantled washing machine, an open book, etc. But it is inconvenient to refuse: what will your friend think? You are already ready to agree, mentally hoping that his case may not have to be dealt with so soon ...</p>
            <p>Stop! Stop! You calmly pronounce the rejection formula: “I respect you and appreciate our relationship. You and I never quarreled and always understood each other. But today I have planned ... (listing specific cases). I must do this, because the meeting is scheduled, the person left and I can no longer inform him about the cancellation of the visit (an important objective reason must be formulated that does not depend on your will and your desire). I know that my inability to help you today will not destroy our relationship that has developed over the years.”</p>
            <p>Remember a situation from your life when you agreed to take your time with the affairs of another person, and therefore suffered from your over-compliance. What could be said in that situation using the rejection formula?</p>
            <p>Imagine what situations of this type you may have in the future. Try to play out your behavior in advance and think through what you will say using the rejection formula.</p>
